This one is much more sane than the one in content.md

1. object / where / what
  - basis: way of looking at things that they look seperate
    - where / space
  - composition / ingredients
  - hierarchy / fractals
  - comparisions / differences

2. process / time / when / how:
  - input
  - output
  - process
    - rules
    - stages
    - exceptions

3. people / benefits / why:
  - perspective
    - knowlege
    - favorites
    - emotions
    - benfits / wants
  - relations / similar / variants
    - reputation

All three are a way of looking at a thing. Look at a person as process. You see how he changed. Look as person, you see desires, benefits, biases. As object, you see the composition.
