This one is much more sane than the one in content.md

1. object / where / what
  - basis: way of looking at things that they look seperate
    - where / space
  - composition / ingredients
  - hierarchy / fractals
  - comparisions / differences

2. process / time / when / how:
  - resultant / effect (don't bother 'bout how, just consider what's)
    - input
    - output
  - process (details of how it happens)
    - rules
    - stages
    - exceptions
  - architection: (useful for designing stuff)
    - manipulations
    - structures
    - assembly
      - logic
      - constraints
      - scheduling

3. people / benefits / why:
  - perspective
    - knowlege
    - favorites
    - emotions
    - benfits / wants
  - relations / similar / variants
    - reputation

All three are a way of looking at a thing. Look at a person as process. You see how he changed. Look as person, you see desires, benefits, biases. As object, you see the composition.
